         compile 'in.mamga:carousalnotification:1.0'

Thats it, you are good to go.

#  Usage

A correct flow to use this library would be :
1) A notification type that will tell you a carousal has to be shows.
2) Upon recieving this notification download the dadata to be shows. (view service for example)
3) Once you have the data, you can build a carousal notification and notify it.
Of course all this can be started from the notification receiver only. But that will make the notification data too bulky to be send over GCM/ FCM.
4) A reciever to recieve events from carousal notification need to written where the library will send carousal item's information whenever one is clicked.

Here is the **detailed steps**. It is assumed that you have fetched the data that need to be shown:

Step 1) Build Carousal instance.

         Carousal carousal = Carousal.with(this).beginTransaction();

Step 2) Set 'contentTitle' and 'contentText' which will be shown when notification is small. Its similar to normal notifications.

         carousal.setContentTitle("Your Title Here").setContentText("Your content description here");
         
Step 3) Build the 'CarousalItem's need to be shown. One way is to parse through the list of fetched data to be shown and build and add carousal items one by one. View documentation for more info.

          CarousalItem cItem = new CarousalItem("Item Id here", "Item Title", "Item Content","Picture Url");
          
          //Additionally we can set a type to it. It is useful if we are showing more than one type
          //of data in carousal. so that we know, where to go when an item is clicked.
          cItem.setType(TYPE_QUOTE);
            
           //Now add item to the carousal
           carousal.addCarousalItem(cItem);
           
   Now this is the interesting part. All of the parts of CarousalItems are optional, lets go through them one by one
   
   1)** Id **  : You may want to save unique id of the object so that you may know which object is clicked on carousal. You may use this id to further fetch details about the item. 
   Alternatively, you may save the entire object's json string into id if you don't have (or want to) individual item's detail api.
   
   2) ** Title ** : Visible below the image of the carousal. Leave it null if you don't want to show any title.
   3) ** Content ** : Visible below the title. Leave it null if you don't want to show any content.
